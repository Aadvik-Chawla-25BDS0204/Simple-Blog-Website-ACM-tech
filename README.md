#Simple Blog Website Design
This project is a simple, Front-end limited, responsive blog webpage built using HTMl, CSS and basic javascript codes. This webpage allows the users t0 create a blog with suitable heading, image and text. All changes made are stored in the LocalStorage.

This project is built by using basic HTML and javascript with CSS for elementary designing.

##Features include
- single blog post 
- Admin login using a single password (adminlogin)
- It can update blog titles, Images and text written and can be saved on the localstorage.


##Technology used:-
-**HTML** - used for basic webpage structure
-**CSS** - used for basic styling (colour,font,button transition)
-**Javascript** - Used for building admin login and a source of localstorage. it was used to assign such features to button.

##Limitations:-
- It cannot store more than one blog
- It has a very small storage
- It can only be used to authenticate a single user rather than a group of users with emails and passwords saved in database
- Due to poor CSS skills of mine, It is very empty from one side
-Image handling requires URL to be provided rather than file explorer fetching
